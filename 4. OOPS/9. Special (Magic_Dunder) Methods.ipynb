They are also sometimes referred to as special methods or \"dunder methods\" because of the double underscores.\n","\n","These methods allow classes to define their behavior for built-in operations, such as addition, subtraction, comparison, and object creation. They enable you to customize the behavior of your objects to make them behave more like built-in types or to define custom behavior for specific operations.\n","\n","Here are a few examples of commonly used magic methods:\n","\n","1. `__init__`: This method is called when an object is initialized. It's used to perform any necessary initialization for the object.\n","\n","2. `__str__`: This method is called when the `str()` function is used on an object, or when the object is printed using `print()`. It should return a string representation of the object.\n","\n","3. `__add__`: This method is called when the `+` operator is used with two objects. It's used to define the behavior of addition for instances of your class.\n","\n","4. `__eq__`: This method is called when the `==` operator is used to compare two objects. It's used to define the behavior of equality comparison for instances of your class.\n","\n","5. `__len__`: This method is called when the `len()` function is used on an object. It's used to define the length of your object.\n","\n","And many more. These methods provide a way to customize the behavior of your classes and make them more intuitive to use. üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚ú®\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","---\n","\n","## What kind of speciality they holds?\n","\n","The specialty of magic methods, or dunder methods, lies in their ability to customize the behavior of your Python classes. Here are some key points that highlight their speciality:\n","\n","1. **Customization**: Magic methods allow you to define custom behavior for your objects. Instead of relying solely on the default behavior of Python's built-in operations, you can tailor how your objects respond to those operations.\n","\n","2. **Integration with Python Features**: They integrate seamlessly with Python's built-in features and syntax. For example, by defining `__add__`, you can use the `+` operator with your custom objects, making them behave like built-in types.\n","\n","3. **Object-Oriented Design**: Magic methods promote good object-oriented design by encapsulating behavior within the class definition. This helps in creating more modular and reusable code.\n","\n","4. **Convenience**: They provide a convenient way to implement common functionality. For instance, `__init__` allows you to initialize object state, `__str__` controls how objects are represented as strings, and `__len__` specifies how to determine the length of objects.\n","\n","5. **Pythonic Code**: Proper use of magic methods makes your code more Pythonic. Python developers expect certain behaviors from objects, and adhering to these conventions improves the readability and maintainability of your code.\n","\n","6. **Expressiveness**: Magic methods enable you to express your intent clearly. By defining `__eq__`, for example, you specify how object equality should be determined, enhancing code clarity.\n","\n","7. **Flexibility**: They provide flexibility in how your objects interact with other objects and Python's ecosystem. This flexibility allows you to create powerful abstractions and libraries.\n","\n","Overall, the specialty of magic methods lies in their ability to empower you as a Python developer to create intuitive, expressive, and flexible classes that seamlessly integrate with Python's syntax and ecosystem.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"GFuk3AzO_nYd"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["if we write `int`
